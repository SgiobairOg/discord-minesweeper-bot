# MineSweep Bot

Creates a Discord bot with slash command to allow creation of an emoji and spoiler based game of Minesweeper.

Game can be generated in four levels: 'Easy', 'Normal', 'Hard', and 'Exxtra' which increas the probability of each cell in the grid being a bomb.

## Limitations

Weirdly enough it turns out you can only have up to 99 spoilers in a single discord message. So the grid for the game is set to 9 x 9. I had planned on giving the user options for the size but given the limited range it wasn't worth it.
